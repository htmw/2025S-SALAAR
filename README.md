# 2025S-SALAAR( plant Leaf disease detection )
It causes immense losses in agriculture, and the earlier a plant disease is found, the better the chances for minimizing damages. 
The classical methods of disease detection are usually slow, not effective, and expensive, especially in large-scale farming.
This area has been evolved with AI: using computer vision and machine learning, the detection of diseases has been done much quicker and more effectively.
While most ML models, such as K-means and SVM, perform poorly in these complex environments, deep learning methods, especially CNNs, have definitely improved the situation of disease detection by automatically learning image features.
Apple plants are quite susceptible to many diseases, like scab and rust; hence, early detection is very essential for protection against quality and yield losses. 
The challenge to detect diseases remains unfruitful due to problems regarding background clutter and variable pattern presentation of diseases. 
# Project Description
Project helps the farmers to decide the better pesticide to be used for the farm with some clear and concise analysis done By Usâ€‹.
For farmers and agriculturalists who face the hurdle of distinguishing and accessing treatment for plant leaf pathogens, the plant leaf disease detection application is a plant bug detection tool powered by machine learning that detects and categorically diagnoses plant ailments from leaf photographs. Unlike traditional inspection methods or straightforward image analyzing mobile applications, our application offers the means to provide a broader plant disease diagnostic scope, resulting in faster actions and enabling users to take action more effectively rather than protecting crops.
