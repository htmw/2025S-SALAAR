# Phytora Overview
It causes immense losses in agriculture, and the earlier a plant disease is found, the better the chances for minimizing damages. 
The classical methods of disease detection are usually slow, not effective, and expensive, especially in large-scale farming.
This area has been evolved with AI: using computer vision and machine learning, the detection of diseases has been done much quicker and more effectively.
While most ML models, such as K-means and SVM, perform poorly in these complex environments, deep learning methods, especially CNNs, have definitely improved the situation of disease detection by automatically learning image features.
Apple plants are quite susceptible to many diseases, like scab and rust; hence, early detection is very essential for protection against quality and yield losses. 
The challenge to detect diseases remains unfruitful due to problems regarding background clutter and variable pattern presentation of diseases. 
# Project Description
Project helps the farmers to decide the better pesticide to be used for the farm with some clear and concise analysis done By Us​.
For farmers and agriculturalists who face the hurdle of distinguishing and accessing treatment for plant leaf pathogens, the plant leaf disease detection application is a plant bug detection tool powered by machine learning that detects and categorically diagnoses plant ailments from leaf photographs. Unlike traditional inspection methods or straightforward image analyzing mobile applications, our application offers the means to provide a broader plant disease diagnostic scope, resulting in faster actions and enabling users to take action more effectively rather than protecting crops.

## Sprint Planning
# 1. Sprint  0  Goals

Plant Leaf Disease Detection project organization is Sprint 0’s goal. The main targets are:

Completing team formation and role allocation.

Creating a Git account and initializing the project skeleton.

Configuring Jira for Agile project management.

Setting up development and testing environment.

Creating epics, user stories, and tasks for a sprint.

Implementing Agile practices such as pair programming, continuous testing, and feedback.

Recording and uploading an introductory presentation


# 2. Team Members & Roles

# 4. Difficulties and Solutions

Problem-Solving Put into practice Adoption of Agile is initially challenging. 

Agile training was given, and expectations were made explicit.

Delays in setting up the environment Senior developers were assigned to mentor junior members.

Providing efficient cooperation For openness, a shared Jira board and daily check-ins were used.

Integration of CI/CD and testing Code reviews and automated testing were first implemented in early 

# 5. Conclusion and Upcoming Actions:

Sprint 0 was effective in laying a solid development foundation.

   **Sprint 1's future priorities will be:**

constructing the fundamental disease detection machine learning model.

constructing the first user interface for the front end.

integrating the cloud for scalability.
