**Phytora Overview :**
Plant diseases cause tremendous loss in agriculture, hence early detection is important. Traditional methods are expensive and labor-intensive, while AI-powered methods using deep learning, especially CNNs, are faster and more accurate diagnosis. Apple trees that are prone to scab and rust diseases must be treated early so as not to lose their yield. However, challenges like background noise and non-homogeneous disease occurrence make detection tricky.
