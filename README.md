It causes immense losses in agriculture, and the earlier a plant disease is found, the better the chances for minimizing damages. 
The classical methods of disease detection are usually slow, not effective, and expensive, especially in large-scale farming.
This area has been evolved with AI: using computer vision and machine learning, the detection of diseases has been done much quicker and more effectively.
While most ML models, such as K-means and SVM, perform poorly in these complex environments, deep learning methods, especially CNNs, have definitely improved the situation of disease detection by automatically learning image features.
Apple plants are quite susceptible to many diseases, like scab and rust; hence, early detection is very essential for protection against quality and yield losses. 
The challenge to detect diseases remains unfruitful due to problems regarding background clutter and variable pattern presentation of diseases.
